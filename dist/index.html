<p>Phantasy Star Online was an action RPG that you could play globally online with other players, first released on the Dreamcast back in 2000. The game got another version on the Dreamcast with more features and a new difficulty level. By the GameCube era it got another expansion in the form of a brand new episode, Episode 2. They also released an Episode 3 to the game, but it played completely differently, chasing the card game trends of the time; it was not very popular. Finally they released Episode 4 with its final release on PC called Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst, returning back to the action gameplay of the first two episodes.</p>
